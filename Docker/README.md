# Docker

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy and run applications by using containers. The containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and deploy it as one package. By doing so the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any Linux machine regardless of any customized settings the machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.
