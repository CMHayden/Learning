# UML

UML, or Unified Modelling Language, is a general purpose, developmental, modelling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.

UML offers a way to visualize a systems architectural blueprints in a diagram showing elements such as:

* Activities or jobs.

* Individual components and how they interact with other components.

* How the system will run.

* How entities interact with other components and interfaces.

* External user interface.

UML diagrams can be structure diagrams, or behavior diagrams based on what they represent.

## Structural Diagrams

Structure diagrams emphasize things that must be present in the system being modeled. Since structure diagrams represent the structure, they are used extensively in documenting the software architecture of software systems. 

Some examples include:

* Class diagrams

* Component diagram

* Object diagram


## Behavior Diagrams

Behavior diagrams emphasize what must happen in the system being modeled. Since behavior diagrams illustrate the bahavior of a system, they are used extensively to describe the functionality of software systems.

Some examples include:

* Activity diagrams

* State machine diagrams

* Use case diagrams

* Interaction diagrams
