# Greensock

Greensock is a java script animation library. It is mostly free to use, but some plugins you must pay for. It is also known as GSAP.

## Getting Started

To get started with greensock animation platform (GSAP) you can use:

* NPM - node package manager used on the command line:

```console
foo@bar:~$ npm install gsap
```

* CDN - content delivery network. You can add a script with the source to the CDN:

```HTML
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/2.1.3/TweenMax.min.js"></script>
```

*To find more gsap libraries check on [cdnjs.com](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/gsap)*

* [Download](https://greensock.com/) - you can download the package directly from Greensock.

## Useful Links

The best resource I have found for gsap has been it's own documentation which can be found [here](https://greensock.com/docs).
