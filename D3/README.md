<a href="https://d3js.org"><img src="https://d3js.org/logo.svg" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="6"></a>

**D3** (or **D3.js**) is a JavaScript library for visualizing data using web standards. D3 helps you bring data to life using SVG, Canvas and HTML. D3 combines powerful visualization and interaction techniques with a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation, giving you the full capabilities of modern browsers and the freedom to design the right visual interface for your data.

D3.js can be found [on github](https://github.com/d3/d3) or [on the D3 website](https://d3js.org).

## Getting started

To get started with D3, you can use the direct download or use a cdn.

### Direct download

You can directly download D3 [here]() and add it manually to your project.

### CDN

With the CDN you just need to copy and paste this script into your html

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js"></script>
```
