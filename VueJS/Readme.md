Vue JS is a progressive framework for building UIs which is widely used across the world for web developmet. It was created by Evan You after working for Google using Angular. Vue was created with the intention of extracting the parts that Evan liked about Angular, and using that to build something lightweight.

### Getting Started

**Direct `<script>` include**

Vue can be downloaded and included directly in a project. The development version can be found [here](https://vuejs.org/js/vue.js) and the production version can be found [here](https://vuejs.org/js/vue.min.js). The development version has helpful console warnings and a debug mode. This is also available through a CDN. This is done by including ```<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"></script>``` for the latest version. For production however, it is recommended you use ```<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.6.11"></script>``` with your prefered version of Vue to avoid anything breaking when new versions are released. 

**NPM**

NPM is the recommended installation method when building large scale applications with Vue. It pairs nicely with module bundlers such as Webpack or Browserify. Vue also provides accompanying tools for authoring Single File Components. To install the latest stable version of vue you can use ```npm install vue```.

**CLI**

You can install Vue with the command line interface which can be found [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). This is not recommended for new users.
