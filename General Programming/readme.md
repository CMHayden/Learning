## Systems Languages

Systems languages build algorithms and data structures from scratch. They use strong typing to help manage complexity of large pieces of software. Focus is often on speed of execution. The easy access to low-level operating system is crucial.

Examples: C, C#

## Scripting Languages

The main purpose of scripting languages is to glue software together. The focus is on rapid-prototyping. Safety aspects are of a lesser concern, so scripting languages are often type-less. Modern scripting languages incorporate features of general purpose programming languages, especially object-oriented (O-O) features. They are easier to learn for casual programming.

Examples: sh, php, python, perl, ruby, lua

### Scripting Languages - A History

They were developed as an abstraction over assembler programs. They are higher-level by introducing abstraction mechanisms to manage large pieces of code.
