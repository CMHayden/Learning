# Learning

A repository with small projects used to learn new libraries and frameworks. This will be continously updated as I progress and learn more. The main focus will be on front end web development, creating APIs, designing databases, and creating mobile applications.

The goal of this project is to practice and learn new libraries, frameworks and languages, while challenging myself to create easy to read and understand documentation for use later.

* Flutter - Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. 

* WordPress - Open source software which you can use to easily create a beautiful website, blog, or app.

* Node Js - Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.

* Django - Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework, which follows the model-template-view architectural pattern. Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites.

* Flask - Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. 

* Angular - Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.

* Vue - Vue.js is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.
