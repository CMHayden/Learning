# Learning

A repository with small projects used to learn new libraries and frameworks. This will be continously updated as I progress and learn more. The main focus will be on front end web development, creating APIs, designing databases, and creating mobile applications.

The goal of this project is to practice and learn new libraries, frameworks and languages, while challenging myself to create easy to read and understand documentation for use later.

## Libraries
* Greensock - GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) is a suite of tools for scripted, high-performance HTML5 animations in all major browsers. Popular, reliable, and fast. [Find greensock here](https://greensock.com/)

* Scene.js - SceneJS is an open-source WebGL-based 3D visualization engine. It is an alternative to GSAP. [Find scene here](http://daybrush.com/scenejs/)

* D3 - D3.js is a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers.  [Find D3 here](https://d3js.org/)

* Chart.js - Simple, clean and engaging HTML5 based JavaScript charts. Chart.js is an easy way to include animated, interactive graphs on your website for free. [Find chart.js here](https://www.chartjs.org/)

* Bootstrap - Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components. [Find bootstrap here](https://getbootstrap.com/)

* Modernizr - Modernizr is a JavaScript library which is designed to detect HTML5 and CSS3 features in various browsers, which lets JavaScript avoid using unimplemented features or use a workaround such as a shim to emulate them. Modernizr aims to provide this feature detection in a complete and standardized manner.  [Find modernizr here](https://modernizr.com/)

* Parsley - Validating forms frontend have never been so powerful and easy. [Find parsley here](https://parsleyjs.org/)

## Frameworks
* Laravel - Laravel is a free, open-source PHP web framework, created by Taylor Otwell and intended for the development of web applications following the model–view–controller architectural pattern and based on Symfony.

* React - React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

* Flutter - Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. 

* WordPress

* Node Js - Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.

* Django - Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework, which follows the model-template-view architectural pattern. Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites.

* Flask - Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. 

* Angular - Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.

* Vue - Vue.js is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.
