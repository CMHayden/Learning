# Learning

A repository with small projects used to learn new libraries and frameworks. This will be continously updated as I progress and learn more. The main focus will be on front end web development, creating APIs, designing databases, and creating mobile applications.

The goal of this project is to practice and learn new libraries, frameworks and languages, while challenging myself to create easy to read and understand documentation for use later.
