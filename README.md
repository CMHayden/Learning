# Learning

A repository with small projects used to learn new libraries and frameworks. This will be continously updated as I progress and learn more. The main focus will be on front end web development, creating APIs, designing databases, and creating mobile applications.

The goal of this project is to practice and learn new libraries, frameworks and languages, while challenging myself to create easy to read and understand documentation for later use, or snippits to be able to grab for other projects. A secondary goal would be to have this project help at least 1 person to learn something new. If this person happens to be you, please get in touch to let me know!

## Projects

Here are links to some larger projects I have done with some of these technologies (if the project link isn't working, the project may be private while working on it, but will be made public once finished):

* [Datastructures and Algorithms](https://github.com/CMHayden/Datastructures-and-algorithms)
Project made to learn and practice different data structures and algorithms. This is a constantly evolving project as I learn new languages, algorithms and data structures. The idea for this project came from a university course called datastructures and algorithms in second year of university at Heriot Watt. The current languages used are:
    * Java
    * C++

* [Dashboard](https://github.com/CMHayden/Laravel-Dashboard)
Simple dashboard made to practice vue. The idea behind doing a dashboard was because at work I see lot's of dashboards in the management software. I though how these are made? And went away to give it a shot. The data used was created by faker.The technologies used were:
    * Laravel
    * Vue
    * Axios
    * Chartisan
    * Faker
    
* [Django Voting App](https://github.com/CMHayden/Django-VotingApp)
Simple voting app made to learn Django. The idea behind this project was curiosity as to how websites such as strawpoll work, and attempting to re-create a simple version of it.The technologies used were:
    * Django
    * Bootstrap
    * SQLite

* [Flask Guestbook](https://github.com/CMHayden/flask-guestbook)
Short flask project I did to see what flask was about. I heard of flask on a podcast and I knew python could be used for web development, but I had never tried. So I came up with the idea of making a guest book. The technologies used were:
    * Flask
    * Bootstrap
    * SQLite

* [SMS Subscriber](https://github.com/CMHayden/management.products.api.subscriber.sms)
